    rough idea: 
    - sample initial trajectories from any half decent distribution over boundary of Xf
    - iteratively:
      - sample points from state space where we would like to know the optimal control 
      - guess the terminal conditions where a trajectory passing close to those points would start
      - evaluate the new trajectories and add them to the data set. 

    no fancy trajectory splitting yet. basically just the more practical version of

# here a long list of considerations about the sampling method
# we want: the k trajectories which come closest to our point
# for that, first find the closest point on each trajectory

# assuming the trajectories are already "kind of" close, there should exist a 
# linear (or convex?) combination of them that goes thorugh our point. how do we find it?
# is it simpler if we assume the trajectories have been sampled at the same value levels? 
# ultra basic method: 
# - find some sort of coefficients quantifying how close each trajectory is to the sampled pt
# - squash them somehow so that they are positive and sum to 1
# - just guess the next terminal state with that squashed convex combination. 
# this will make sure we actually have a convex combination of the trajectories at hand, 
# regardless of irregular sampling of the closest points. 

# softmax is a natural first guess

# ALSO this does not consider at all what happens when conflicting local solutions are 
# among the closest. then, the convex combination of terminal conditions is probably
# meaningless. instead, we might have to do one/several of those things:
# - select only the "best" trajectories from the cloesest ones to start the next one
# - perform some k-means thing on (x, Î») to find the different local solutions
# - come up with some other smart thing

# to some order j, and associated matrices {A^0, ..., A^j}. but still maybe this is dumb. 
# is this even what we want? probably only when the trajectories are already close enough
# to warrant thinking about the Xf boundary in terms of its tangent space anyway. 
# let's try it like this for now -- the cases where xfs are far apart is anyway not the
# most interesting one.

# can we just not care and start the PMP from the proposed xf? possible
# issues: 

# - different linear and nonlinear system, maybe already wrong info on
# boundary of Xf. should not be large thoug if linearisation good and Xf
# small. 
# - bookkeeping a bit more cumbersome, need to retroactively find
# terminal costate to be compatible with re-using the dataset.
