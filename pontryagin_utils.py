    was I fundamentally mistaken before about the nature of this problem? 

        u* = argmin_u H(x, u, lambda) = argmin_u l(x, u) + lambda.T @ f(x, u)

    obviously the whole problem changes linearly with lambda. but does that 
    say anything about how the *solution* changes with lambda? not so sure.

    the whole thing is a quadratic in u: 

        H(x, u, lambda) = H + H_u u + .5 u.T H_uu u

    where the RHS is evaluated at (x, 0, lambda) -- quadratic taylor expansion
    in u about 0. l is quadratic in u (by construction) and f is affine in u
    (control affine!) so this I am pretty sure about. 

    But: H changes as a function of x in possibly weird ways! therefore if we 
    want to solve the problem with KKT matrices, we have to recalculate the
    KKT matrices every time from the nonlinear system :(

    from a quick numerical check, it looks like: 
     - H_u is not constant across varying (x, u, lambda)
     - but H_uu is :) 

    this first one is only true if l_uu is also constant, which in our case it
    is. should we put that as basic assumption? or be more lax and say just
    that we assume we can reliably calculate (and autodiff) u*(x, lambda)? 

    therefore our QP looks like this: 

        u* = argmin_u .5 u.T H_uu u + H_u(x, 0 lambda) u (+ H)
        s.t. G u <= l  

    H_uu is constant so no arguments. H_u is evaluated at u=0, but (x, lambda)
    change.  The constant term H(x, 0, lambda) is irrelevant.

    This does not look that bad after all. there is one specific place for our
    parameter 

        p := H_u(x, 0, lambda) 

    to enter, and otherwise we have a constant QP. Now, i *think* what
    confused  me is this: it may well be that the QP solution is piecewise
    linear *in p*. but p as a function of (x, lambda) is NOT piecewise linear,
    easily verified by  plotting it along some line in (x, lambda) space. This
    is not a bad thing as long as we use the chain rule or jax correctly, and 
    not confusing grad_p u* with grad_(x, lam) u*. 

    In fact, H_u = l_u(x, u) + lambda.T @ g(x), if f(x, u) = fstate(x) + g(x) u
    so we see neatly where the nonlinearity comes from.

    some new-ish thoughts. 
    we can easily write down all KKT matrices for all active sets. we can then do 
    one of two things. 
    1) explicitly invert each KKT matrix, to find the linear map from parameter 
       to solution (and lagrange multipliers) as a nice matrix. 
    2) store all KKT systems and solve online. 

    2 is certainly better numerically (matrix inversion bad!!!) but we will
    have to store differently sized matrices in some pytree thing. OTOH, with 1
    we might incur some numerical error but have a nice collection of equally sized 
    matrices we can store in an array of shape (N_activesets, dim(u)+dim(mu), dim(p)).
    
    checking KKT conditions afterwards should be the same regardless. I am pretty 
    sure now that directly checking KKT conditions is miles better than taking 
    the lowest-cost solution inside constraints, because for two close solutions
    with distance d, the objective only differs like d^2, whereas the KKT residuals
    (i think) are all linear-ish. therefore much better numerically. for another day :)
